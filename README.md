# Raspberry Pi Server written in Rust

This project is a toy project that I have been using to 
learn how to program in Rust

I don't really know what direction I am headed with it,
suggestions are welcome.


## Developing

Clone this repository, then navigate to the app folder
```bash
$ cd raspberrypi-rocket-rust-server/app
```

Use cargo to run and build
```bash
$ cargo run
```
